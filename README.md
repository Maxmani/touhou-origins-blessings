## Touhou Origins: Blessings <img alt="Icon" height="16" src="/src/main/resources/assets/touhoublessings/icon.png" width="16"/>
An add-on for the [Origins](https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric) mod inspired by the [Touhou Project](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki) series.
In addition to choosing an origin, you now also choose a blessing, which will buff (or debuff) your character in unique ways.

Requires:

- [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric)
- [Origins](https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric)
